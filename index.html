        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Miles Janow and I have a confession to make - I didn’t always enjoy writing. It wasn’t until my junior year of high school that I actually found a way to make it bearable. I have gained strengths and skills, but I still have some aspects that need to be worked on. Some of my big strengths as a writer include incorporating hooks and tying them back into the conclusion of papers, and making my essays simple to understand by using the appropriate amount of context for the audience. My weaknesses as a writer include laziness and a lack of motivation to do my work until I get started, at which point I will have enough energy to finish the whole thing. As a reader, I can easily understand what is going on in a story and discuss it with others; however, I have difficulty speed reading. I need to take my time or I will miss crucial information and lose interest in the text. Regarding editing, I am very skilled at finding simple mistakes and noting how they can be corrected. This includes mistakes such as punctuation, confusing grammar, and missing context that could confuse the reader. I am not very skilled at finding faults with evidence and warrants. This is mainly because when I edit I do not have the time to look at and completely process every possible mistake in each warrant.

        <h2>Growth as a Writer</h2>
        <p>
            From the beginning of this year, I have grown as a writer in a multitude of ways. Firstly, I have developed a deeper understanding of writing warrants. At the beginning of the year, I relied on using evidence as my main source for pushing my argument to the point where my warrants were almost just restatements of my quoted text. I now understand that evidence is not what convinces the reader; it simply bolsters an idea that is already there. Also, I have improved my structure and flow throughout my papers. At the start of the year, I was overwhelmed with the methods of writing and how to organize my papers so that they were easy to read and simple to understand. It would take me a long time to figure out where to start, what information to put and where, and how to transition from sentence to sentence to make my papers flow. But after writing over a half dozen papers for English this year, I can safely say that I have figured it out; I now understand what type of writer I am and how to organize my papers efficiently. As it is currently the end of this school year, I can say that writing has gotten a whole lot easier than when I first started this class, as well as a whole lot more fun.

        <h2>Growth as an Editor</h2>
        <p>
            As an editor, I have improved in both editing speed and quality. My first peer edit at the beginning of this year was very difficult for me. There were so many sections I had to focus on at once, and it seemed like it would take forever for me to finish just one paper. At this time, I had trouble reading through and understanding any piece of text I had read. I could not understand what the common structure of an essay was, where the thesis would be, or anything crucial to deeply process and think about what was written. Because of this, I had a tough time editing papers, for I did not know what I was looking for. After writing and editing more and more, I started to recognize what most essays look like and more importantly, what they are supposed to look like. I had gotten quicker at finding mistakes and could see much more than I originally had. For example, my first peer edit of the year had only a few markups and write-ins on how to improve. Conversely, my most recent edit has marks on punctuation errors, comments about confusing grammar, and notes where paragraphs are lacking in content.

        <h2>Writing Do's and Don'ts</h2>
        <h3>Do's:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Write about something you are interested in</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    This will make finding inspiration and the motivation to write much easier. It will also help you learn more about something you like.
                </li>
            <li>Support your claims with sufficient evidence</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    It is difficult to count your opinion as reliable without a credible source’s information to back it up. The evidence should be clear and objective.
                </li>
            <li>Know your audience</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    When writing, always be aware of what your readers may and may not know about your topic and its context.
                </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Don'ts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Procrastinate</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    Having to write an essay that may or may not be interesting sucks, but waiting until the last minute to do so will only make it worse.
                </li>
            <li>Write without structure</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    It is easy to ramble on and write junk without some form of structure. The absence of this will confuse readers and they will likely stop reading.
                </li>
            <li>Forget to proofread</li>
                <li class="sub-list">
                    A good essay with bad grammar or misspelled words can drop down from professional to amateur in a matter of words.

        <h2>Expert Writing Quotes</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    “Good writing avoids errors. Talented writing makes things happen in the reader’s mind—vividly, forcefully—that good writing, which stops with clarity and logic, doesn’t” – Samuel R. Delany. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Your stuff starts out being just for you, in other words, but then it goes out. Once you know what the story is and get it right-- as right as you can, anyway-- it belongs to anyone who wants to read it” – Stephen King (King). I like this quote because it shows how different readers interpret pieces of text and how writers use it as inspiration for their projects.
                <li>
                    “Perfectionism is the voice of the oppressor, the enemy of the people. It will keep you cramped and insane your whole life, and it is the main obstacle between you and a shitty first draft” – Anne Lamott (Temple). This quote is great because writing is not supposed to be perfect. Writing is an interpretation of oneself and will be different for each person who reads it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “The good reader is one who has imagination, memory, a dictionary, and some artistic sense” – Vladimir Nabokov (Nabokov). I included this quote because it perfectly describes the mental state of what Nabokov says: a good reader.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Art does not come from ideas. Art does not come from the mind. Art comes from the place where you dream. Art comes from your unconscious; it comes from the white-hot center of you” – Robert Olen Butler (Temple). I chose this quote because I like the idea of art just being manifested due to who you are rather than from thinking or logic.
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Don’t write what you know, write toward what you want to know” – Colum McCann (Temple). This is a good quote to include because it tells truths about writing with passion. Writing about something you want to know about will make you more interested and excited to learn as you are writing, which will help transfer your voice to the reader.

        <h2>Writer's Memo</h2>
        <p>
            When I was first presented with this writing project, I had thought that getting this done on time would be impossible. I am not a creative nor a crafty person, so I knew that making this happen with excellence would take the most out of me. Luckily, I was able to create a website as my “creative” part, so I was still able to write my content in an essay/outline format and just paste it over after I was done. The hardest part of this essay was writing in the first person. I have familiarized this to be taboo up until now, so breaking that pattern was a struggle. If I could go back and do this again, I would create a truly creative project, such as a scrapbook or three-dimensional art piece.
